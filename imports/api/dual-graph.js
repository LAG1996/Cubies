//Class representing the dual graph of a polycube
//In this case, we refer to the face dual graph and the edge dual graph, the edge analogue to the face dual graph.
//We use the ES6 method of defining the class and the WeakMap technique to defining private properties

//Static members
const DG_PRIVATES = new WeakMap();
export class DualGraph{
	constructor(){}
}

//Private methods


//Class representing the nodes in the dual graph
const DGN_PRIVATES = new WeakMap();
class Node{
	constructor(){}
}
